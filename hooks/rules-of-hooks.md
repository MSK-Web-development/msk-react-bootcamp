# Rules of hooks

- You can use hooks only inside function components. Not inside class components because classes already have features what hooks enable you to do.

- You should call Hooks only at the top level of the function. Donâ€™t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.

- There is just one other valid place to call hooks - your own custom hooks.
